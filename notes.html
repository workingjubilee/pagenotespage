<!-- Welcome! This is a complete document of notes on HTML. It explains what the parts of an HTML tag, and even some details on best practices. As you have just noticed, an HTML page begins with the <html> tag, and it will end with a closing </html> tag as well! Anything between < > is a tag or an additional descriptor attached to it, and a / indicates a closing of that same tag. -->
  <head>
    <!-- This is the head tag. It contains "metadata", or data that is not normally viewed by people browsing the page, because it's not relevant to them, but might be viewed by search engines or the devices. An example of metadata about non-digital objects, for instance, would be the information in a library about where a book is located, who the author is, what genre it is, and if it's in a series, including the book's own identifying labels. In our case, the metadata in the head can even include information on how our HTML page is meant to be read, which is kind of like calling the ink, paper, and binding of a book "metadata" since they're not the actual words, which might be a bit confusing, but would make sense if our physical books were assembled on-the-spot, as HTML pages are. -->

  <body>
    <!-- All of the normally-viewable elements in an HTML document go within the body tag. -->
    <!-- Topics to cover:
    1) most pertinent tags but not all (doc too long if covering all)
    2) semantic html
    3) on the css page, the basics of the box model
    4) how to view the source and suggestions regarding text editors
    5) the selectivity
    6) how to organize things (lateral and then vertical)
    possibly have both a "basic" for introductory purposes and then an "advanced" quick-reference
